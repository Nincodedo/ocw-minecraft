# OCW Minecraft

## Radical Hardcore

Radical Hardcore (RHC) is a multiplayer game mode that uses Minecraft's Hardcore difficulty with one extra rule. If any player dies, the entire server is deleted and a new world is started.

### End Of The World Announcements

When any player dies, it is announced to everyone on the server. The Overworld's weather turns to rain/thunder and a countdown bossbar is displayed. Players are kicked after the countdown is completed. The world is deleted and a new one starts. If a Discord webhook URL was supplied, the death and new world startups will be announced there as well.

### Non-Vanilla Standard Features

There are a few non-vanilla Java Minecraft features implemented through datapacks.

- [Custom composter items](customcomposter/index.md)

### OCW Features

There are a lot of additional custom features added for the OCW community in the [ocw-stuff datapack](https://github.com/Nincodedo/rhc-ocw/tree/main/datapacks/ocw-stuff). It can be safely removed if you're only looking for the RHC content. [Full details on the OCW features can be found here](ocw/index.md).
