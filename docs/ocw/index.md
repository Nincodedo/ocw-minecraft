## Player Gifts

OCW players have specific gifts that when given to them grant you an advancement. If you complete all the gift advancements for a player, you will be given a [Player Head](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Head#Player_skins) of them.

## Unique Items

Unique Items are custom items specially created for an individual OCW player. All unique items are bound to a specific OCW player and the item's powers will only activate for that player. They can be found in structures related to that player or in the [Library's Forbidden Wing structure](#the-librarys-forbidden-wing). Some unique items have special abilities, or over-powered enchantments, or both! The enchantments are slightly randomized so you may receive different enchantments than shown in any screenshots here.

### Iridium Rod

The Iridium Rod is a fishing rod for Nincodedo. It has a chance of fishing up a second fish/treasure/junk. It can be found in the [Cave Base](#cave-base).
